George Washinton


George Washington (February 22, 1732  – December 14, 1799) was a Founding Father and the first president of the United States,
serving from 1789 to 1797. As commander of the Continental Army, Washington led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War against the
British Empire. He is commonly known as the Father of His Country for his role in bringing about American independence.

Born in the Colony of Virginia, Washington became the commander of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War (1754–1763). He was later 
elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, and opposed the perceived oppression of the American colonists by the British Crown. When the American 
Revolutionary War against the British began in 1775, Washington was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. He directed a poorly organized
and equipped force against disciplined British troops. Washington and his army achieved an early victory at the Siege of Boston in March 1776 but were 
forced to retreat from New York City in November. Washington crossed the Delaware River and won the battles of Trenton in late 1776 and Princeton in 
early 1777, then lost the battles of Brandywine and Germantown later that year. He faced criticism of his command, low troop morale, and a lack of 
provisions for his forces as the war continued. Ultimately Washington led a combined French and American force to a decisive victory over the British at
Yorktown in 1781. In the resulting Treaty of Paris in 1783, the British acknowledged the sovereign independence of the United States. Washington then 
served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted the current Constitution of the United States.
