The avocado, alligator pear or avocado pear (Persea americana) is an evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae).
It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated in Mesoamerica more than 5,000 years ago. It was prized for its large and unusually oily fruit.
The tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala. Avocado trees have a native growth range from Mexico to Costa Rica.

Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as an alligator pear or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed
Sequencing of its genome showed that the evolution of avocados was shaped by polyploidy events and that commercial varieties have a hybrid origin
Avocado trees are partly self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain consistent fruit output. Avocados are presently 
cultivated in the tropical and Mediterranean climates of many countries.  As of 2023, Mexico is the world's leading producer of avocados,supplying 29%
of the global harvest of 10.5 million tonnes.The fruit of domestic varieties have smooth, buttery, golden-green flesh when ripe. Depending on the cultivar,
avocados have green, brown, purplish, or black skin, and may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. For commercial purposes, the fruits are picked
while unripe and ripened after harvesting. The nutrient density and high fat content of avocado flesh are advantages for various cuisines, including vegetarian diets.

In major production regions like Chile, Mexico and California, the water demands of avocado farms place strain on local resources.  Avocado production is
implicated in other externalities, including deforestation and human rights concerns associated with the partial control of their 
production in Mexico by organized crime. Global warming is expected to result in significant changes to the suitable growing zones for 
avocados, and place additional pressures on the locales in which they are produced due to heat waves and drought.


The earliest known written account of the avocado in Europe is that of Martín Fernández de Enciso (c. 1470 – 1528) in 1519 in his book, Suma De Geographia Que
Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo, while describing the native settlement of Yaharo (present-day Dibulla, Colombia). The first detailed 
account that unequivocally describes the avocado was given by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés in his work Sumario de la natural historia de las Indias
in 1526, while holding administrative Spanish colonial duties in Santo Domingo and visiting Castilla de Oro. The first written record in English of the
use of the word 'avocado' was by Hans Sloane, who coined the term, in a 1696 index of Jamaican plants.

The word avocado comes from the Spanish aguacate, which derives from the Nahuatl (Mexican) word āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ], which goes back to the proto-Aztecan.
In Molina's Nahuatl dictionary "auacatl" is given also as the translation for compañón "testicle", and this has been taken up in popular culture where
a frequent claim is that testicle was the word's original meaning. This is not the case, as the original meaning can be reconstructed as "avocado" 
– rather the word seems to have been used in Nahuatl as a euphemism for "testicle". The modern English name comes from a rendering of the Spanish aguacate
as avogato. The earliest known written use in English is attested from 1697 as avogato pear, later avocado pear (due to its shape), a term sometimes corrupted to alligator pear.

In Central American, Caribbean Spanish-speaking countries, and Spain it is known by the Mexican Spanish name aguacate, while South American Spanish-speaking
countries Argentina, Chile, Perú and Uruguay use a Quechua-derived word, palta. In Portuguese, it is abacate. The Nahuatl āhuacatl can be compounded with
other words, as in ahuacamolli, meaning avocado soup or sauce, from which the Spanish word guacamole derives.
